1. Modify inotify_init, inotify_add_watch, and related inotify syscalls
so that inotify can recursively watch all sub-directories.

2. Currently, if we want to monitor the sub-directories, we need to add
a separate watch for each sub-directory. We want to modify inotify to
allow it to monitor a directory and all its sub-directories at once.

3. fs/notify/inotify/inotify_user.c
fs/notify/inotify/inotify.h
fs/notify/inotify/inotify_fsnotify.c

4. inotify_event in uapi/linux/inotify.h

5. None.

6. Add a watch to a directory with one sub-directory. Check if creating,
moving, copying files from or to the sub-directory can be detected by
inotify.

7. All will be written in C.

8. Week 1: figure out how inotify works.
Week 2: design our approach.
Week 3: implement.
Week 4: evaluation.
Week 5: presentation and writeup.
